# Web Interface

This directory contains the web interface for the multi-service application, built using React. 

## Structure

- **public/**: Contains publicly accessible files such as HTML and CSS.
- **src/**: Contains the source code for the React application.
  - **components/**: Contains React components.
  - **App.js**: The main component that sets up the application structure.
  - **index.js**: The entry point for the React application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the web interface, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `web-interface` directory:
   ```
   cd web-interface
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Build

To create a production build of the web interface, run:
```
npm run build
```

This will generate static files in the `build` directory that can be served by a web server.
