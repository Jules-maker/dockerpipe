# Project Overview

This is a multi-service application that consists of three main components: a Laravel service, an Express.js service, and a web interface built with React. Each service is containerized using Docker, and they communicate with each other through a defined network.

## Services

1. **Laravel Service**: This service handles the backend logic and API endpoints. It is built using the Laravel framework and includes all necessary configurations, routes, and database interactions.

2. **Express.js Service**: This service provides additional backend functionality using Express.js. It handles specific routes and requests, interacting with the database as needed.

3. **Web Interface**: The frontend of the application is built using React. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the backend services.
